  # Logic Gates Implementation in Verilog

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of basic digital logic gates, along with their simulation results using a waveform viewer.


## Introduction

This project implements basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR using Verilog. Each gate is simulated, and the results are visualized using a waveform viewer. These gates are fundamental building blocks in digital electronics, and their Verilog implementations serve as an essential exercise for VLSI design.

## Logic Gates

1. **AND Gate**: Outputs `1` only when both inputs are `1`.
2. **OR Gate**: Outputs `1` if at least one input is `1`.
3. **NOT Gate**: Inverts the input (outputs `1` if input is `0` and vice versa).
4. **NAND Gate**: Outputs `0` only when both inputs are `1` (inverse of AND gate).
5. **NOR Gate**: Outputs `0` if at least one input is `1` (inverse of OR gate).
6. **XOR Gate**: Outputs `1` if the inputs are different.
7. **XNOR Gate**: Outputs `1` if the inputs are the same (inverse of XOR gate).
